#+TITLE: csv-concat

* Summary
  This project has a simple purpose - concatenate similar csv files together, line by line. 

  It might seem like this could be achieved pretty simply by the following command ~cat one.csv two.csv >> three.csv~
  this tool is (only slightly) more sophisticated than that, however. 

  Features:
  - Concatenate all files matching ~./*.csv~ into ~all.csv~
  - Ignores headers after the first file
  - Optionally includes an additional column called /File/ which specifies which file the row came from
  - User can optionally change the ~./*.csv~ and ~all.csv~ options in interactive mode
    

* Usage
  
#+BEGIN_SRC shell

csv-concat interactive
